<h3>Let me tell you a little bit about myself.</h3> 
 
 <p>I grew up in Boulder, Colorado. I attended Foothill Elementary, Centennial Middle School and graduated from Boulder High School. I attended St. John’s College for my undergraduate studies. I took a year off in between my sophomore and junior year of college and worked on a kibbutz in Israel. There I had the chance to stock shelves in a store, dig ditches, tend gardens, and I even took care of animals in a petting zoo!</p>
 
<p>At the end of college I met, Haley, the love of my life and the woman who would become my wife. She liked me at first but she did not fall madly in love with me until I won a pie eating contest. I continued to pursue my interest in becoming a teacher by working at the Santa Fe Children’s Museum and at the Boys & Girls Club. Haley and I moved to Oregon together and lived there for several years while she finished college. I went to graduate school to learn how to become a better teacher at Lewis & Clark College.</p>
     
   <p>Haley and I moved back to my hometown of Boulder, Colorado in 2010. During the week you will find me teaching social studies at September High School. Thank you for welcoming me. I look forward to learning more about you.</p>
